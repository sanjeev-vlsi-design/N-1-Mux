# N-1-Mux
N:1 Multiplexer (MUX)
An N:1 Multiplexer (MUX) is a fundamental digital circuit that selects one of N input signals and forwards it to the output based on the value of select lines. This repository showcases the design, functionality, and applications of an N:1 MUX implemented in Verilog.

Overview
A multiplexer is an essential component in digital systems, often referred to as a "data selector." The circuit allows multiple data sources to share a single transmission line or resource, making it highly efficient for managing data flow in hardware systems.

Key Features
Scalable Design: Supports any number of inputs (N), determined by parameterization.
Efficient Selection: Uses a binary select signal to determine the active input.
Synchronous Operation: Works seamlessly in clock-driven systems or combinational circuits.
Customizable: Easily configurable for various input sizes and use cases.
Functional Description
Inputs:
Data Inputs (N lines): The data signals to be multiplexed.
Select Lines: Binary control signals used to select one of the inputs.
Output:
Single Data Output: The value of the selected input line.
Selection Mechanism:
The number of select lines is determined by

N is the number of inputs.
Each combination of select signals corresponds to a specific input being routed to the output.
